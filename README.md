Practice with python dependency injection using python-inject @ https://github.com/ivankorobkov/python-inject

This project was created to learn how to perform dependency injection, the pythonic way using [**python-inject**](https://github.com/ivankorobkov/python-inject).

## What I've Learned

> Preface: Until recently (3/1/2019) I've never *knowingly* used dependency injection. The design pattern was not something I was consciously aware of, however I have leveraged it in several projects as well as production.

* Dependency injection is more of a development pattern than anything else.
* Contrary to my original confusion, there are multiple ways of tackling dependency injection.
* Spring and Guice tackle this ...

## Closing Thoughts

* Dependency injection is certainly a useful concept for, and leveraging this in Python can help keep otherwise redundant code clean and concise.
